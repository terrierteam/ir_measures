``alpha_nDCG``
-------------------------


A version of nDCG that accounts for multiple possible query intents.

  booktitle={SIGIR},
  year={2008}
}

**Parameters:**

- ``cutoff`` (int) - ranking cutoff threshold
- ``rel`` (int) - minimum relevance score to be considered relevant (inclusive)
- ``alpha`` (float) - Redundancy intolerance
- ``judged_only`` (bool) - calculate measure using only judged documents (i.e., discard unjudged documents)


**Provided by:**

- ``pyndeval``: ``alpha_nDCG(alpha=ANY, rel=ANY, judged_only=ANY)@ANY``


``Accuracy``
-------------------------

The accuracy metric corresponds to the probability that a relevant
document is ranked before a non relevant one. This metric is intended
to be used as a diagnostic metric (checking discrepancies between
train, validation and test with pairwise costs). As such, runs
with no relevant document are discarded.

**Parameters:**

- ``cutoff`` (int) - ranking cutoff threshold
- ``rel`` (int) - minimum relevance score to be considered relevant (inclusive)


**Provided by:**

- ``accuracy``: ``Accuracy(cutoff=ANY, rel=ANY)``


``AP``
-------------------------


The [Mean] Average Precision ([M]AP). The average precision of a single query is the mean
of the precision scores at each relevant item returned in a search results list.

AP is typically used for adhoc ranking tasks where getting as many relevant items as possible is. It is commonly referred to as MAP,
by taking the mean of AP over the query set.

canonical form when printed.

- ``MAP_IA`` → ``AP_IA``
- ``MRR`` → ``RR``
- ``NDCG`` → ``nDCG``
- ``NumRelRet`` → ``NumRet(rel=1)``

- ``Recall`` → ``R``
- ``RPrec`` → ``Rprec``
- ``SetRelP`` → ``SetP(relative=True)``
- ``α_DCG`` → ``alpha_DCG``
- ``α_nDCG`` → ``alpha_nDCG``
